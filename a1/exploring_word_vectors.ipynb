    "## Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Vectors are often used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g. question answering, text generation, translation, etc., so it is important to build some intuitions as to their strengths and weaknesses. Here, you will explore two types of word vectors: those derived from *co-occurrence matrices*, and those derived via *GloVe*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Terminology:** The terms \"word vectors\" and \"word embeddings\" are often used interchangeably. The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) states, \"*conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension*\"."

    "Most word vector models start from the following idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "*You shall know a word by the company it keeps ([Firth, J. R. 1957:11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rupert_Firth))*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many word vector implementations are driven by the idea that similar words, i.e., (near) synonyms, will be used in similar contexts. As a result, similar words will often be spoken or written along with a shared subset of words, i.e., contexts. By examining these contexts, we can try to develop embeddings for our words. With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) or [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190530091127/https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285))."

    "\n",
    "A co-occurrence matrix counts how often things co-occur in some environment. Given some word $w_i$ occurring in the document, we consider the *context window* surrounding $w_i$. Supposing our fixed window size is $n$, then this is the $n$ preceding and $n$ subsequent words in that document, i.e. words $w_{i-n} \\dots w_{i-1}$ and $w_{i+1} \\dots w_{i+n}$. We build a *co-occurrence matrix* $M$, which is a symmetric word-by-word matrix in which $M_{ij}$ is the number of times $w_j$ appears inside $w_i$'s window among all documents.\n",

    "\n",
    "The matrix rows (or columns) provide word vectors based on word-word co-occurrence, but they can be large. To reduce dimensionality, we employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), akin to PCA, selecting the top $k$ principal components. The SVD process decomposes the co-occurrence matrix $A$ into singular values in the diagonal $S$ matrix and new, shorter word vectors in $U_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dimensionality reduction maintains semantic relationships; for instance, *doctor* and *hospital* will be closer than *doctor* and *dog*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those unfamiliar with eigenvalues and SVD, a beginner-friendly introduction to SVD is available [here](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf). Additional resources for in-depth understanding include lectures [7](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [8](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), and [9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf) of CS168, providing high-level treatment of these algorithms. For practical implementation, utilizing pre-programmed functions from Python packages like numpy, scipy, or sklearn is recommended. While applying full SVD to large corpora can be memory-intensive, scalable techniques such as Truncated SVD exist for extracting the top $k$ vector components efficiently."

TruncatedSVD returns U\\*S, so we need to normalize the returned vectors, so that all the vectors will appear around the unit circle (therefore closeness is directional closeness). **Note**: The line of code below that does the normalizing uses the NumPy concept of *broadcasting*.

    "Polysemes and homonyms are words that have more than one meaning (see this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) to learn more about the difference between polysemes and homonyms ). Find a word with *at least two different meanings* such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contain related words from *both* meanings. For example, \"leaves\" has both \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meaning in the top 10, and \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\". You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**: You should use the `wv_from_bin.most_similar(word)` function to get the top 10 most similar words.
